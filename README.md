# hello-world
Hi, 
My name is Joshua.
Learning to use Git and Github feels like real professional software development.
I am learning about this because I want to develop Python code projects and other coding projects.
These other projects will include machine learning / data science stuff that will revolutionise the way I work.
My productivity will be unparallelled and I will add a lot of value to my team and to the human race.
One reason I am getting into coding more seriously is because of my childhood dream to build androids and robots.
